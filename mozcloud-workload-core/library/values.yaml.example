# Example values showing a visual representation of the parameters accepted by
# this library chart.

# This is used to populate the default value for "target" for ExternalSecret
# resources.
appCode: tenant-name

# This is used to populate the default value for "gsm.secret" for ExternalSecret
# resources.
environment: dev

# If you set this, it will be the default name for all resources if not
# specified at the resource level.
#
# Ideally, resources would be named in a way that follows this hierarchy:
#
#    1. Name set at the subcomponent/most specific level (eg. backend service
#       name), if applicable.
#    2. Name set at the component/parent level (eg. HTTPRoute).
#    3. Name of the chart (equivalent to "application.fullname"). <- we are here
#    4. Default name of the library chart (eg. mozcloud-gateway).
#
# Subcharts cannot pull metadata or values from parent charts unless the parent
# chart passes them in as parameters. Rather than asking users to specify their
# chart name as part of their values files, I went with the approach of
# allowing users to specify a name that would be used if component/subcomponent
# names were not set.
#
# If no names are set at all in this chart, the default library chart name will
# be used: mozcloud-workload-core.
