# Example values showing a visual representation of the parameters accepted by
# this library chart.

# app_code, chart, component_code, env_code, and projectId should all be
# defined as global values in the parent Helm chart's values file(s) outside the
# scope of this Helm chart.
#
# For example:
#
#   # my-app/values.yaml
#   global:
#     mozcloud:
#       app_code: my-app                 # should match app_code in tenant file
#       chart: my-chart                  # the name of the chart
#       component_code: web              # should match component_code in tenant file
#
#   # my-app/values-dev.yaml
#   global:
#     mozcloud:
#       env_code: dev                    # should match .Values.environment
#       projectId: moz-fx-my-app-nonprod # should match realms.<realm>.project_id in tenant file
#
# These are used to populate labels and metadata in MozCloud charts.

# Name to be used for all resources if not specified at the resource level.
# This overrides the chart name set in .Values.global.mozcloud.chart but is

    #
    #   2. name & projectId: Use these together to automatically construct the
