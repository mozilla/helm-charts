# Example values showing a visual representation of the parameters accepted by
# this library chart.

# app_code, chart, component_code, and environment should all be defined as
# global values in the parent Helm chart's values file(s) outside the scope of
# this Helm chart.
#
# For example:
#
#   # my-app/values.yaml
#   global:
#     mozcloud:
#       app_code: my-app    # should match app_code in tenant file
#       chart: my-chart     # the name of the chart
#       component_code: web # should match component_code in tenant file
#
#   # my-app/values-dev.yaml
#   global:
#     mozcloud:
#       environment: dev    # should match .Values.environment
#
# These are used to populate labels and metadata in MozCloud charts.

# Name to be used for all resources if not specified at the resource level.
# This overrides the chart name set in .Values.global.mozcloud.chart but is
# overridden by names defined at the resource level.

    #
    #   2. name & projectId: Use these together to automatically construct the
